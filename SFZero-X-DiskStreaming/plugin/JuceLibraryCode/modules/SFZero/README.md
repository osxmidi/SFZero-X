---------------

This is a fork of the [original SFZero by Steve Folta](https://github.com/stevefolta/SFZero), with the following changes:

* has been converted to a Juce module, so you can easily consume it from your own projects (you still get the sample player plugin, but it now includes that module)
* requires Juce 4.1 or higher
* supports Juce 4.1 module format
* now also supports new Juce 4.2 module format (thanks to Loki Davison)
* conveniently sits within its own `sfzero::` namespace
* has a tidied-up code base, so it now builds with as few warnings as possible on all platforms and on both 32/64 bit architectures. I also simplified logging, added support for synchronous sample loading, and fixed a few bugs.

For more information, please see also this [blog article](http://www.mucoder.net/blog/2016/03/24/sfzero.html)

Please note that, in order to build, SFZero requires [Juce](http://www.juce.com).

Before building the plugin, it's necessary to

* copy the modules/SFZero folder as a childfolder to your Juce modules folder.
* load `plugin/SFZero.jucer` into your IntroJucer tool and save the project again. This should regenerate the project build definitions with the proper links to your Juce module location.
